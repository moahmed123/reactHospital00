  "readme": "# react-infinite-scroll-component [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/react-infinite-scroll-component.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-infinite-scroll-component.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component)\n\nA component to make all your infinite scrolling woes go away with just 4.15 kB! `Pull Down to Refresh` feature\nadded. An infinite-scroll that actually works and super-simple to integrate!\n\n# install\n```bash\n  npm install --save react-infinite-scroll-component\n\n  // in code ES6\n  import InfiniteScroll from 'react-infinite-scroll-component';\n  // or commonjs\n  var InfiniteScroll = require('react-infinite-scroll-component');\n```\n\n# demos\n- [See the demo in action at http://ankeetmaini.github.io/react-infinite-scroll-component/](http://ankeetmaini.github.io/react-infinite-scroll-component/). Thanks [@kdenz](https://github.com/kdenz)!\n- The code for demos is in the `demos/` directory. You can also clone and open `lib/index.html` in your browser to see the demos in action.\n\n# using\n\n```jsx\n<InfiniteScroll\n  pullDownToRefresh\n  pullDownToRefreshContent={\n    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>&#8595; Pull down to refresh</h3>\n  }\n  releaseToRefreshContent={\n    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>&#8593; Release to refresh</h3>\n  }\n  refreshFunction={this.refresh}\n  next={fetchData}\n  hasMore={true}\n  loader={<h4>Loading...</h4>}\n  endMessage={\n    <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n      <b>Yay! You have seen it all</b>\n    </p>\n  }>\n  {items}\n</InfiniteScroll>\n```\n\nThe `InfiniteScroll` component can be used in three ways.\n\n- Specify a value for the `height` prop if you want your **scrollable** content to have a specific height, providing scrollbars for scrolling your content and fetching more data.\n- If your **scrollable** content is being rendered within a parent element that is already providing overflow scrollbars, you can set the `scrollableTarget` prop to reference the DOM element and use it's scrollbars for fetching more data.\n- Without setting either the `height` or `scrollableTarget` props, the scroll will happen at `document.body` like *Facebook's* timeline scroll.\n\n\n# props\nname | type | description\n-----|------|------------\n**next** | function | a function which must be called after reaching the bottom. It must trigger some sort of action which fetches the next data. **The data is passed as `children` to the `InfiniteScroll` component and the data should contain previous items too.** e.g. *Initial data = [1, 2, 3]* and then next load of data should be *[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]*.\n**hasMore** | boolean | it tells the `InfiniteScroll` component on whether to call `next` function on reaching the bottom and shows an `endMessage` to the user\n**children** | node (list) | the data items which you need to scroll.\n**loader** | node | you can send a loader component to show while the component waits for the next load of data. e.g. `<h3>Loading...</h3>` or any fancy loader element\n**scrollThreshold** | number | a threshold value after that the `InfiniteScroll` will call `next`. By default it's `0.8`. It means the `next` will be called when the user comes below 80% of the total height.\n**onScroll** | function | a function that will listen to the scroll event on the scrolling container. Note that the scroll event is throttled, so you may not receive as many events as you would expect. \n**endMessage** | node |  this message is shown to the user when he has seen all the records which means he's at the bottom and `hasMore` is `false`\n**style** | object | any style which you want to override\n**height** | number | optional, give only if you want to have a fixed height scrolling content\n**scrollableTarget** | node | optional, reference to a (parent) DOM element that is already providing overflow scrollbars to the `InfiniteScroll` component.\n**hasChildren** | bool | `children` is by default assumed to be of type array and it's length is used to determine if loader needs to be shown or not, if your `children` is not an array, specify this prop to tell if your items are 0 or more.\n**pullDownToRefresh** | bool | to enable **Pull Down to Refresh** feature\n**pullDownToRefreshContent** | node | any JSX that you want to show the user, `default={<h3>Pull down to refresh</h3>}`\n**releaseToRefreshContent** | node | any JSX that you want to show the user, `default={<h3>Release to refresh</h3>}`\n**pullDownToRefreshThreshold** | number | minimum distance the user needs to pull down to trigger the refresh, `default=100px`\n**refreshFunction** | function | this function will be called, it should return the fresh data that you want to show the user\n**initialScrollY** | number | set a scroll y position for the component to render with.\n",
